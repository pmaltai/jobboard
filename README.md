# 💼 JobBoard – Full-Stack Portfolio Project

A real-world job board application built using **React**, **Django**, **Tailwind CSS**, and **Docker**. This project demonstrates my full-stack development skills, including frontend design, backend API creation, Dockerized environment setup, and deployment readiness. The app is presented with relaxing classical music for a calm coding vibe.
